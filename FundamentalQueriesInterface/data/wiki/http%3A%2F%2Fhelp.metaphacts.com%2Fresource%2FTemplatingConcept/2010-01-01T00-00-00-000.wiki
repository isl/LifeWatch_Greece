== Background: WIKI ==
The platform wiki provides a simple way of creating and customizing lightweight applications on top of any knowledge graph.

The entire UI is based on standard HTML being generated by a wiki engine and and such can easily be changed using the wiki editor. 
Standard <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting/" target="_blank">wiki syntax</a> makes it easy also for non-developers to modify and add content or visualizations. 
As such collaborative editing and publishing of static and dynamic content is easy as with any content management system (CMS). 

==Static vs. Dynamic Content ==
The most significant difference compared to a standard wiki is the fact that within the platform wiki all pages
are being identified by so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier" target="_blank">unique resource identifiers (URI)</a>, 
which is the same mechanism as being used for identifying enities within a knowledge graph.
In turn this means that:
* A wiki page <b>CAN</b> be used to represent a human-read able view of an entity within the knowledge graph.
* But a wiki page <b>DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE</b> a corresponding entity in the knowledge graph. 

A wiki page <b>MAY</b> display static content (being stored by the wiki engine) as well as dynamic content being retrieved from the knowledge graph.

An extension of the wiki syntax allows to add special [[Help:Start | widgets]] to any wiki page in order to include dynamic graph knowledge into your application.

== Templating ==
In the world a of knowledge graphs it is important to distinguish between instances data and model data.  
Instances such as, for example, a representation of a particular person can be typed according to an ontology (model) as, for example, being <i>of type Agent</i>.

In principle, it is possible to create a wiki page for every instance <i>of type Agent</i> within the knowledge graph manually. 
However, so called <b>wiki templates</b> can be used to define views which are being automatically applied to entire sets of instance, for example, to all instances <i>of type Agent</i>.

To create a new or modify an existing wiki template, just follow the link within the top of the wiki editor when editing a instance page (i.e. when editing a instance page, applicable templates are being listed in the top).
