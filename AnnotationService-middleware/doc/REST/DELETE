==== DOCUMENTATION ====
http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/#retrieve-a-known-annotation
These are from 4.2.2 of Web Annotation Protocol

Clients may retrieve an Annotation from its advertised URI with the HTTP GET method. 
Servers MUST support the JSON-LD representation using the Open Annotation profile, Turtle, 
and MAY support other RDF serializations, other JSON-LD profiles, and other JSON-LD contexts.

Content negotiation for different JSON-LD contexts is performed by adding a profile parameter 
to the JSON-LD media type in a space separated, quoted list. The URI that defines the Open Annotation 
profile is http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/jsonLdProfile and other specifications 
may define other such profiles. (Additional Constraint)

The response MUST have a Link header entry where the target IRI is http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Resource 
and the rel parameter value is type. The Annotation type MAY also be added.

The response MUST have an ETag header, an Allow header, and a Vary header, as previously described.
