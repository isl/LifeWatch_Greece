# Lifewatch Greece Data Services
---
## Introduction

Data Services provide the users with tools in order to:
* publish their datasets and make them available to the community by providing information that allows a user to locate and access the resource and its curator/creator,
* import their datasets to the Lifewatch Greece Infrastructure and to GBIF or MedOBIS,
* perform biodiversity data and information quality improvement, and 
* search about datasets of interest by providing an efficient way of querying semantic networks. 

The schema of the data that is provided by the users is mapped to the semantic model of the LWI and the data is transformed to LWI format before it is stored to the Infrastructure. The semantic model is based on CIDOC CRM (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/), CRM dig, CRM geo, CRM sci and MarineTLO (http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/MarineTLO/).

## The Components

The data services are composed of two main components:
* the API that provides the functionalities for storing/accessing/managing the data, and
* an interface of SOAP services for exposing these functionalities in a standard way.
